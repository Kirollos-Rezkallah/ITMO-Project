# University ITMO Web Form Project

## Overview
This project is a web form implementation for [University ITMO](https://www.itmo.ru/). The objective was to create a user-friendly interface with a responsive design, including a navbar, page indicators, main form, and footer.

## Features Implemented
1. **Navbar:**
   - Implemented a responsive navigation bar using Bootstrap.

2. **Page Indicators:**
   - Utilized radio buttons to visually indicate the current page to the user.

3. **Main Form:**
   - Created a structured main form with relevant input fields and labels.
   - Ensured desktop and tablet responsiveness using Bootstrap classes.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Focused on **desktop** and **tablet** responsiveness but acknowledges that additional work is needed for optimal mobile experience.

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Form Files Design:**
   - The design for form file inputs has not been fully aligned with the provided design. This requires attention for a consistent look.

2. **Mobile Version:**
   - While the design is suitable for desktop and tablets, further adjustments are needed for an optimal mobile experience.

3. **Footer:**
   - The footer has not been implemented yet. This component should be added for completeness.

4. **Backend and Database**
    - The backend server and database to receive form submissions are not implemented in this version. Future iterations may include these components.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap: Utilized for styling and responsiveness.
